# MathUtils - Static Methods in Python

This project demonstrates how to use **static methods** in Python using a simple utility class `MathUtils`. It includes a static method `add(a, b)` that performs addition without using any class or instance variables.

## âœ… Features

- Uses `@staticmethod` decorator
- No instance or class variables used
- Can be called without creating an object

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- Python 3.x

## ðŸš€ Installation

1. Download the script or clone the repository.
2. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use

```python
# Call static method directly from class
result = MathUtils.add(10, 20)
print(result)  # Output: 30
