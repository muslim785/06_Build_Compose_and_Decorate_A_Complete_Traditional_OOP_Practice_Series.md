# Python Callable Objects using `__call__()` Method

This example shows how to make a Python object **callable like a function** by implementing the special `__call__()` method. We also use the built-in `callable()` function to verify this behavior.

## âœ… Features

- Implements the `__call__()` method in a class
- Demonstrates how objects can be used like functions
- Uses `callable()` to check if an object is callable

## ðŸ’» Full Code

```python
class Multiplier:
    def __init__(self, factor):
        self.factor = factor

    def __call__(self, value):
        return value * self.factor

# Example usage
m = Multiplier(5)

# Check if the object is callable
print("Is m callable?", callable(m))

# Use the object like a function
result = m(10)
print("Result of m(10):", result)

### ðŸ“˜ Summary

With `__call__()`, you can turn objects into function-like behaviorâ€”this is especially useful in advanced programming like decorators, machine learning pipelines, or middleware design.

Would you like to extend this example to support addition or other operations as well?
