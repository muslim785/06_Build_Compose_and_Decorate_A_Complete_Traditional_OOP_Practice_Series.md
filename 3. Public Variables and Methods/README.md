This Python program defines a `Car` class with a **public variable** `brand` and a **public method** `start()`. It demonstrates how public variables and methods can be accessed from outside the class.

## Features
- Defines a `brand` variable that is public and can be accessed directly.
- Defines a `start()` method that can be called from outside the class.
- Demonstrates how to use public methods and variables in Python.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your machine.

## How to Use
1. Instantiate the `Car` class.
2. Access the `brand` public variable.
3. Call the `start()` public method.

### Example Usage:

car1.start()  # Output: The Toyota car is starting.
