# 🏦 Bank Class - Class Variables and Class Methods with Multiple Banks

This Python project demonstrates the use of **class variables** and **class methods** by modeling a banking system. It defines a `Bank` class with:

- A list of available banks (`ABL`, `HBL`, `UBL`, `SBL`)
- A class variable `bank_name` that can be updated
- A class method to change the current active bank
- A method to display all available banks

## ✅ Features

- Uses **class variables** shared among all instances
- Provides a list of **predefined banks**: `ABL`, `HBL`, `UBL`, `SBL`
- Uses **class methods** to:
  - Change the bank name
  - Show all available banks
- Demonstrates how changes to class variables reflect across all objects

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x
